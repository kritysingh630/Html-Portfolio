    <hr/>

    <h3>Dear Zindagi</h3>
    <p>It's a beautiful movie about a girl overcoming depression and breaking people's mindset of a taboo in India that is to not go to therapy as they think of this as a "pagal/dimaag ka doctor" and finally getting to enjoy the little and big things in life.I love this movie because of how such a big problem among people nowadays struggling with depression is portrayed in a good way.</p>

    <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
    <p>I love the animation and the simplicity of the ghibli.</p>

    <h3>Rush Hour 1 2 3</h3>
    <p>This movie has action and a lot of humor.It's a feel good movie. </p>
